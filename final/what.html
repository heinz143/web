<h3 class="what">DIFFERENT DIET OPTIONS</h3>

<div class="diets">

<p class="title">Plant-Based</p>
    <hr class="line">
<p class="right">A plant-based diet is a diet consisting mostly or entirely of foods derived from plants, including vegetables, grains, nuts, seeds, legumes and fruits, and with few or no animal products. A plant based-diet is not necessarily vegetarian.</p>

<p class="title left">Vegetarian</p>
    <hr class="line">
<p class="left">Vegetarianism is the practice of abstaining from the consumption of meat, and may also include abstention from by-products of animals processed for food. Vegetarianism may be adopted for various reasons. Many people object to eating meat out of respect for sentient life.</p>

<p class="title">Vegan</p>
    <hr class="line">
<p class="right">Veganism is the practice of abstaining from the use of animal products, particularly in diet, and an associated philosophy that rejects the commodity status of animals. A follower of the diet or the philosophy <br>is known as a vegan. Distinctions may be made between several categories of veganism.</p>

<p class="title left">Pescatarian</p>
    <hr class="line">
<p class="left">A pescatarian is someone who chooses to eat a vegetarian diet, but who also eats fish and other seafood. It's a largely plant-based diet of whole grains, nuts, legumes, produce and healthy fats, with seafood playing a key role as a main protein source. Many pescatarians also eat dairy and eggs.</p>
